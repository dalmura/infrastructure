# Provision Authentik for dal-indigo

This guide covers the overall setup of the Authentik instance deployed as part of `wave-3`.

Eventually this configuration will be moved into the likes of the [Authentik Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/goauthentik/authentik/latest/docs), but for now it's here!

We assume you've followed the steps at:
* [`dal-indigo-core-1` Apps - Wave 3](INDIGO-CORE-1-APPS-WAVE-3.md) and have Authentik running with your own admin user

TBD

## Finally
You can now proceed with setting up Vault: [`dal-indigo-core-1` Apps - Wave 3 - Vault Configuration](INDIGO-CORE-1-APPS-WAVE-3-VAULT.md)
